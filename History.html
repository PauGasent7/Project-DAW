        <p>
            The National Basketball Association, better known simply by its acronym NBA, is a private professional basketball league played in the United
            States since 1949, when the professional leagues National Basketball League (NBL, created in 1937) and Basketball Association of America 
            (BAA, founded in 1946) merged. As a private entity, it does not officially depend on the American Basketball Federation. NBA players are allowed 
            to compete internationally under a special three-way agreement signed between the International Basketball Federation (FIBA) -the world's 
            leading basketball organization-, the NBA itself and the American Federation in 1989.

            It was at the end of World War II when a group of men -most of them owners of some of the sports venues in different American cities- met 
            at New York's Madison Square Garden in order to look for alternatives to fill those halls with something more than ice hockey and boxing,
            which attracted large audiences but were not able to fill their capacity. Thinking of something completely different that would be able to 
            complete the calendar, in addition to offering the American population a new entertainment, they saw in basketball the ideal event to achieve 
            their goals. Thus, on June 6, 1946, the Basketball Association of America (BAA), which years later became known as the NBA, was 
            born and became one of the most followed sports leagues in the world.

            Since the 2004-05 season, it has consisted of 30 teams or franchises divided into two conferences,
            he East and the West, which in turn are divided into three divisions of five teams each.
            The most decorated player in terms of rings is Bill Russell with eleven championships in thirteen years, the competition's all-time leading 
            scorer is the American Kareem Abdul-Jabbar with 38,387 points in twenty seasons, the player with the most individual awards is Michael 
            Jordan and the one who holds the most individual statistical records is Wilt Chamberlain. The reigning champion is the Milwaukee Bucks, 
            who won their second title, defeating the Phoenix Suns.
