                The National Basketball Association or better known as "NBA" is a private American basketball league,
                ranked as the best in the world in this sport.
                It has 30 teams competing against each other, all located in the United States throughout the country,
                except one, the Toronto Raptors, which is located in Canada.
                It was created in 1946, just after the Second World War, when several owners of different sports
                entities met in New York,
                specifically in the mythical Madison Square Garden, to look for ideas on how to fill that stadium and
                many others in the North American country.
                On June 6, 1946, the Basketball Association of America (BAA), later renamed the NBA,
                was born and became one of the most followed sports leagues in the world.
            </p>
            <p>
                Since the 2004-05 season, the NBA has 30 teams, with the expansion of the Charlotte Hornets, who are
                divided into two conferences:
                the East and the West (composed of 15 teams each), in turn, divided into 3 divisions of 5 teams each.

                One of the most mitical phrases is:
            </p>
            <blockquote>
                <p>
                    The strength of the team is in each individual member. The strength of each member is in the team.
                </p>
                <p>
                    - (Phil Jackson)
                </p>
            </blockquote>
            <h2>Regular season format</h2>
            <p>
                First of all, we should know that a normal NBA season is divided into the regular season and the
                playoffs or post-season.
                The first is where the 30 teams try to reach the best possible win-loss balance.
                Each franchise will play 82 games (in some cases, such as the lockout, fewer games are played, but these
                are very particular cases).
                As I mentioned before, the 30 teams are divided into two conferences, East and West, 15 for each one
                according to the geographical position of each city.
                Of these 15 teams, the best 8 with the best balance are the ones that will play the post-season,
                therefore, there are 16 teams that play playoffs and 14 that are already thinking about the next season.
            </p>

            <h2>Playoffs format</h2>
            <p>
                Once we reach April, the 30 teams have completed their 82 games, the best 8 of each conference qualify
                to compete against each other to achieve the coveted ring.
                Although it may seem that the regular season is not important, it is very important, because depending
                on the position in which you are,
                your first round opponent and future rounds will be defined in case of winning.
            </p>
            <p>
                Once we have the 16 teams, we must split both conferences as two totally isolated tournaments, we will
                see why.
                From here, we get the 8 of each conference to face each other according to their position, against the
                rival of the other position:
            </p>
            <p>
                1 vs 8, 2 vs 7, 3 vs 6 and 4 vs 5.

                That is the format, that is, the team with the best balance faces the eighth, the one with the worst
                balance.
                The second, against the second worst and so on. This first round, and the rest, are 7 games, that is,
                you have to win 4 to advance to the next round.
            </p>
